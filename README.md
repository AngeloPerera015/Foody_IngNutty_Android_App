# Foody_IngNutty_Android_App

This is an Android application project that I am completing and continuing for my 2nd-year university degree. This idea came to mind because I’m a consumer who pays attention to off-the-shelf food ingredients and nutrition. To be aware of that, one must check the actual product that is on shelves or at home. This application can be browsed with a fingertip to become aware of food ingredients and nutrition.

The name is Foody IngNutty, an acronym for food ingredients and nutrition. It aims to provide off-the-shelf food products with ingredients and nutrition, as it’s necessary to make customers aware of this. Also, it contains useful features to improve and maintain a healthy lifestyle for the user.

The application system design (functionalities) is as follows:

The application's features and functionalities are as follows:

From the beginning, the user can use the application without signing in. From the Main screen, the user can view the Image slider, and from the Image button, they can move forward to the Product category to get information on selected food Ingredients and Nutrition in a Dialog box.

On the Main screen, Hamburger Menu (available on primary screens), More to access the Nutrition plan, which shows the food pyramid in a Pie chart, and Health Advice plays some Videos on healthy tips and a Check box checklist to check the user's evaluation, and a Pedometer to show the user’s step count and Location.

After the More, in Reach Us E-mail to communicate with the service provider, in Google Form to provide Feedback and Suggestions, and in Community, the user can Sign up and communicate with other users as well.

In the end, after pressing the Back button twice within 2 seconds, the user can exit the application successfully.

The application UIs are as follows:
